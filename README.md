## Microsoft-Classifying-Cybersecurity-Incidents-with-MachineLearning
This project focuses on building a machine learning model to classify cybersecurity incidents into categories such as True Positive, Benign Positive, or False Positive. The goal is to enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of Security Operations Centers (SOCs). The model employs sophisticated data processing methods and classification algorithms to aid in improving incident analysis and response.
### Key Components
**Data Exploration and Cleaning:** Involves conducting an initial inspection of the dataset to understand its structure and quality, handling missing values through imputation or removal, and detecting and addressing outliers to ensure the data is clean and reliable for model training.

**Feature Engineering:** Entails the creation and selection of features that significantly contribute to the classification task. This includes transforming raw data into meaningful features, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical values to improve model performance.

**Model Training:** Involves training various classification algorithms, such as Random Forest and Logistic Regression, on the processed dataset. This step includes fine-tuning model parameters using techniques like hyperparameter optimization to enhance predictive accuracy.

**Model Evaluation:** Assesses the performance of the trained models using key metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. This step involves comparing different models and selecting the one that best balances performance and interpretability.
